# Advanced Books API

An advanced RESTful API built with Go for managing a collection of books. This API features CRUD operations, JWT-based authentication, request logging, and pagination.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete** (CRUD) books.
- **JWT Authentication** for secure access.
- **Pagination** for GET requests.
- **Logging** of requests and response times.
- **PostgreSQL Database** for data persistence.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- PostgreSQL
- [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
- [JWT-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go)
- [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
2. Set up PostgreSQL and create a `books` table.
3. Configure your PostgreSQL credentials in `models.go`.
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
## Run the server:

```bash
go run main.go


```
